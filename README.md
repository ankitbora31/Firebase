# Introduction
- Simple API with Firebase Firestore
- Simple API for storing, accessing, updating and deleting the user details.
- function for encryption of passwords added


##  :beginner: About
API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Google’s infrastructure.


## :zap: Usage
One of the top reasons developers use APIs is to integrate one system with another system.
APIs can help improve software and system testing by allowing quality engineering teams to separate tests for frontend components, the parts of software that users see, from tests for backend components, the parts of software that users don’t see.
Firebase is a less technical and time-saving alternative to writing full-fledged backend code for dynamic apps.
With Firebase, it's pretty simple to connect and use built-in third-party authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among others. And if you want to use a pre-built authentication UI, you have it at your disposal as well.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- Steps on how to install this project, to use it.
- This project was done on Springboot (It is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework)
- Starting with the installation (step by step, nothing complex)
- Using Spring Initializer generating the structure of the project. Like name of the project, adding dependencies and setting the version.
- Installing Postman is must as we need to test our API
- Firebase can be accessed in the browser no external installations
- create an account for free and start a project
- Generate a serviceAccountKey json file from the service accounts in projects settings in firebase and add it to springboot project
- create a firestore database
- in the service accounts sdk configuration is provided copy it and add to the springboot


### :notebook: Pre-Requisites
- Java Core
- Firebase
- SpringBoot
- Postman

###  :nut_and_bolt: Development Environment
- Dependencies can be set while starting the project in spring initializer phase although if you miss any of the dependency, these can be further added in pom file which stores all the dependencies. When we initialize the spring it already provides us a pom file.
- This project is done using maven so the structure is to be followed while adding dependencies.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.
